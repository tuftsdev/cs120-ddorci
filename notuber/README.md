## Assignment Requirements Part (1)
- All needed parts have been implemented correctly (google maps api used, cars positioned correctly, speed optimizations recorded)
- speed before optimization: 909 kB transferred, 1.6 MB resources, Finish: 3.02 s, DOMContentLoaded: 1.06 s
- speed after optimization:  909 kB transferred, 1.6 MB resources, Finish: 1.87 s, DOMContentLoaded: 442 ms
- speed optimization included all things list in Canvas requirements.
- Worked with no one.
- 1.5 hr working on the lab.

## Assignment Requirements Part (2)
- All needed parts have been implemented correctly (found and marked position, make successful request to the ride-hailing API, marked all vehicles, infowindow for distance to closest, polyline made to closest)
- Only one call to ride-hailing API and Google Maps API were used.
- Implemented "Going Beyond" bullet point 2, each car has a clickable infowindow that displays its distance to the user.
- Worked with no one. Used the provided Stackoverflow post:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9713058/sending-post-data-with-a-xmlhttprequest and Google Maps API docs.
- 2.5 hrs working on the lab.
